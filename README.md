# QLDPC-Decoders
## This is a repository for code related QLDPC code projects

* QLDPC_decoders.py contains a HDRG-type algorithm for QLDPC codes.

### Hyper graph product codes
* We compare the performance of several HGP codes to isolated surface codes made from the same qubit resources.


### Good LDPC
* we test the performance of so-called good LDPC codes using our HDRG decoder.
